Broadcom Cygnus Power Management device tree bindings

Cygnus power management support allows for system entering and exiting
power savings states. Power management is enabled by a low-power
co-processor dedicated to Power Management.

Required SoC Specific Properties:
- compatible: should be "brcm,cygnus-pm"

Optional SoC Specific Properties:
- aon_regulators: A sub-root node containing child aon_regulator nodes
  describing AON regulators, which need to be externally disabled while in
  certain PM states
- aon_regulators node has the following properties:
	- Required properties
		- gpio: gpio to use for enable control
	- Optional properties:
		- startup-delay-us: startup time in microseconds
		  If this property is missing, the default assumed is 0.
		- enable-active-high: Polarity of GPIO is Active high
		  If this property is missing, the default assumed is Active low
		- regulator-state-standby sub-root node for Standby
		  (Cygnus sleep) mode
		  : standby, the device is in a power-saving state, but can also
		  receive certain events, specific behavior depends on the
		  specific device.
		- regulator-state-mem sub-root node for Suspend-to-RAM
		  (Cygnus deepsleep) mode
		  : suspend to memory, the device goes to sleep, but all data
		  stored in memory, only some external interrupt can wake the
		  device.
		- regulator-state-mem sub-root node for Cygnus OFF mode
		  : poweroff, the core part of the device is powered off, only
		  some external interrupt can wake the PM co-processor;
		  the device goes through a full boot on wakeup.
		  If this node is missing, regulator state is not modified upon
		  entering and exiting the corresponding PM state.
		- regulator-state-[standby/mem/off] node has the following
		  common properties:
			- regulator-external-off-in-suspend: regulator should be
			  disabled by a PM co-processor while in the
			  corresponding PM state.
			  If this property is missing, regulator state is not
			  modified upon entering and exiting a PM state.

Example:

/ {
	cygnus-pm {
		compatible = "brcm,cygnus-pm";

		aon_regulators {
			a_regulator {
				gpio = <&gpio_x 1 0>;
				startup-delay-us = <50000>;
				enable-active-high;
				regulator-state-mem {
					regulator-external-off-in-suspend;
				};
				regulator-state-off {
					regulator-external-off-in-suspend;
				};
			};
			b_regulator {
				gpio = <&gpio_x 4 0>;
				regulator-state-off {
					regulator-external-off-in-suspend;
				};
			};
		};

	};
};
